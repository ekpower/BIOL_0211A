Basic Arithmetic
```{r}
# add
2 + 2

# multiply
2 * 2

# exponent
2^10
```

Objects
```{r}
# create an object
count.chocula <- 2^10

# print the object you created
count.chocula

# redifine the previously created object
count.chocula <- 100

# what kind of object is count.chocula?
class(count.chocula)

# make a new object
froot <- "froot loops"

# what kind of object is froot?
class(froot)

# help function
?class

# make another object
# in this case, the c function is going to make a vector
luckycharms <- c(2,4,6,8,10)

# print the new object
luckycharms

# perform algebra on the new object
luckycharms/2
```
